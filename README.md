## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I use this?
logbook requires that you connect your browser through an internal proxy server hosted by logbook. Please use the PAC file generator feature to create proxy configuration file for your browser.
If you prefer to do it manually, please configure your browser to use localhost and port 8888 (default) as the proxy.

If done correctly, it will automatically pick up information as soon as you visit the main menu or perform an action.

#### Is this safe?
~~Logbook only looks at the packets coming into your browser and uses that information to display all information that it can. It **does not** affect the packets in any way.~~ You are on your own.

#### A ship/item/quest is missing a translation!
Please report them to on [GitHub](https://github.com/silfumus/logbook-EN/issues) or complain in the place you know where.
